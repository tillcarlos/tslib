Some general instructions to get the library running. This document will improve over time.
Thanks for using tslib!

rJAVA
=====
Running rJava in mac OSX Lion via command line:
java -cp bin:lib/* -Djava.library.path=lib avh.informatik.cau.REngineFacadeTest

In eclipse: Set the variable acccordingly. It is _not_ sufficient to do a System.setProperty!

Alternatively, you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly, as described in
REngineFacade.
